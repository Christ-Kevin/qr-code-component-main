### What I learned

This project was the easiest, i ever had. I made alot of mistakes in my last project and I made this project to have some motivation and energie to face a herdest project. 
I could work with Figma for the first time, that's what I think I learned here

### Continued development

I would like to improve my workflow as a developper. With workflow I mean this process when you think once you have a project and you have to develop a strategie how you want to build your project and how to go threw issues while developping the Website
